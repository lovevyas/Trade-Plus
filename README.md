# Trade Plus 🛍️📊  
**Smart Sales Insights & Dynamic Pricing for Small Businesses**

---

## 📌 Problem
Most small business owners in India (and globally) sell on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or even offline shops.  
While big e-commerce companies use **data-driven pricing strategies**, small sellers:  
- Rely on **static prices**  
- Miss **sales trends**  
- Lack access to **simple, affordable insights**  

As a result, they lose potential revenue and fail to optimize stock and pricing.

---

## 💡 Solution – Trade Plus
**Trade Plus** is a lightweight, cloud-backed platform that helps small business owners by:  
1. 📈 **Tracking sales performance** (fastest-selling vs. slowest-moving items)  
2. 🤖 **Suggesting price changes** (based on demand trends)  
3. 🔔 **Notifying sellers** when action is required (low stock, high demand, etc.)  
4. ☁️ **Cloud-hosted** → secure, scalable, accessible from anywhere
